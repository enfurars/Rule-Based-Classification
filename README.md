Level-Based Customer Revenue Calculation with Rule-Based Classification

## Description
This project predicts the revenue of new customers by classifying the previous user data. Step by step approach by using Explotary Data Analysis is applied. 

## Business Problem
A gaming company wants to create level-based customer personas using certain customer characteristics and then predict how much the potential new customers could contribute to the company based on these newly defined personas.

- For example, they want to determine how much an average 25-year-old male user from Turkey using IOS could contribute.

## Dataset
The "persona.csv" dataset -which can be found under data folder in the project directory- contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information of the customers who made the purchases. The dataset is formed from records generated with each sale. This means that the table is not singularized, implying that a user with certain demographic characteristics might have made multiple purchases.

- Price: Customer spending amount
- Source: Device type connected by the customer
- Sex: Customer gender
- Country: Customer country
- Age: Customer age
